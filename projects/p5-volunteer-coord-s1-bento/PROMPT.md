## YOUR TASK
You are an expert frontend developer and UI designer. You will generate a complete,
production-ready Next.js 16 web application as a functional MVP.

Generate ALL THREE files below in ONE response. Use the EXACT delimiters specified.
Do not add any explanation text, markdown, or commentary outside the delimiters.

## PROBLEM CONTEXT
Local social groups and NGOs collect a lot of important information about community needs
through paper surveys and field reports. However, this valuable data is often scattered across
different places, making it hard to see the biggest problems clearly.

Objective: Design a powerful system that gathers scattered community information to clearly show
the most urgent local needs. Build a smart way to quickly match and connect available volunteers
with the specific tasks and areas where they are needed most.

## THIS SPECIFIC TOOL
**Name:** NeedMapper
**Tagline:** Paste community survey data or field notes — extract and rank the most urgent needs
**Domain:** NGO operations, volunteer management, community needs assessment, social impact

**What the user does:**
Raw community survey responses, field report text, or any unstructured community data

**What they see as output:**
Top 10 ranked community needs, urgency scores, affected population estimates, geographic clustering, and priority categories

**How Gemini AI is used:**
Extract, categorize, and rank community needs from unstructured text. Identify urgency signals, frequency of mention, severity indicators, and population affected. Output a structured, ranked needs assessment.

## UI STYLE REQUIREMENT
BENTO BOX GRID UI STYLE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Core concept: The entire page is a grid of distinct rectangular cards (the "bento boxes").
Each card has a clear purpose and contains self-contained content. The grid is asymmetric —
cards vary in size (1×1, 2×1, 1×2, 2×2 units) creating visual hierarchy.

Visual language:
- Dark background (near-black #0a0a0a or deep navy) with colored card backgrounds
- Cards have subtle borders and slight rounded corners (8-12px)
- Each card has its own accent color or subtle gradient
- Typography is bold and large for headers inside cards
- Dense but organized — lots of information visible at once
- Card hover states with subtle glow or border highlight
- Numbers and stats get their own dedicated large-number cards

Layout rules:
- Use CSS Grid with auto-placement
- Main interaction card should be 2×2 or span full width
- Result cards populate the grid dynamically
- Mobile: stack to single column

Colors: Use the problem's color hint as your palette base.
Fonts: Choose a distinctive geometric sans-serif for headers, clean mono for data.
DO NOT: use white backgrounds, use equal-sized cards, use standard list layouts.

## GEMINI API INTEGRATION
- Model: `gemini-1.5-flash`
- API Key env var: `process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY` (available server-side only)
- API Endpoint in your route: `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash:generateContent?key=${API_KEY}`
- The API route is at: `/api/generate` (POST)
- Request body your page sends: `{ "prompt": "user input text here" }`
- Response your API route returns: `{ "result": "gemini response text" }`

Gemini prompt to use in your API route (customize for this tool):
"You are a community needs analysis AI for NGOs. Analyze this raw community data and extract: top 10 urgent needs ranked by severity, urgency score for each (1-10), estimated affected population, need category (health/food/shelter/safety/education/livelihood), and key quotes or signals that indicate urgency. Format as a clear prioritized list."

Append the user's actual input to this system prompt when calling Gemini.

## TECH CONSTRAINTS (STRICT)
- Framework: Next.js 16, App Router (`app/` directory)
- Language: TypeScript (.tsx files)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS + custom CSS variables in globals.css
- Icons: lucide-react only (already installed)
- NO additional npm packages — only: next, react, react-dom, lucide-react, tailwindcss
- Build command: `next build --no-turbo`
- Node engine: 24.x
- The Gemini API call happens in `app/api/generate/route.ts` (server-side only)
- The page uses client-side fetch to call `/api/generate`
- Add `'use client'` directive to `app/page.tsx`

---

## FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
1. User sees a clean, styled input form matching the UI style described above
2. User fills in the required input fields (described in "What the user does" above)
3. User clicks a submit/analyze button
4. A loading state is shown while waiting for Gemini
5. The Gemini response is displayed in a well-styled results section
6. The result should be parsed and displayed with visual hierarchy (not just raw text)
7. Error states are handled gracefully
8. The page is fully responsive (mobile + desktop)

---

## OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY)
Respond with EXACTLY this structure. No text before or after. No markdown code fences
inside the blocks. Use these exact delimiters:

--- FILE: app/page.tsx ---
[complete TypeScript React component code here]
--- FILE: app/api/generate/route.ts ---
[complete Next.js API route code here]
--- FILE: app/globals.css ---
[complete CSS with Tailwind directives and all custom styles here]
--- END ---

## QUALITY REQUIREMENTS
- The UI must look PROFESSIONAL and POLISHED — not like a placeholder
- The UI style must be immediately recognizable as Bento Box Grid
- Loading states must be visually clear
- Results must be formatted with visual hierarchy, not raw text dumps
- The tool name "NeedMapper" must appear prominently in the UI
- Color palette must reflect: warm green and earthy orange — community warmth meets organized action
- Choose distinctive, non-generic fonts (use Google Fonts via @import in globals.css)
- The app should feel like a real product someone would use

Generate now. Only output the three file blocks.
