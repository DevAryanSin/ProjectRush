## YOUR TASK
You are an expert frontend developer and UI designer. You will generate a complete,
production-ready Next.js 16 web application as a functional MVP.

Generate ALL THREE files below in ONE response. Use the EXACT delimiters specified.
Do not add any explanation text, markdown, or commentary outside the delimiters.

## PROBLEM CONTEXT
Computer programs now make life-changing decisions about who gets a job, a bank loan,
or even medical care. However, if these programs learn from flawed or unfair historical data,
they will repeat and amplify those exact same discriminatory mistakes.

Objective: Build a clear, accessible solution to thoroughly inspect data sets and software models
for hidden unfairness or discrimination. Provide organizations with an easy way to measure, flag,
and fix harmful bias before their systems impact real people.

---

## THIS SPECIFIC TOOL
**Name:** DataMirror
**Tagline:** Input your dataset columns and sample values — detect discriminatory proxies hiding in your data
**Domain:** AI fairness, bias detection, algorithmic accountability, ethics

**What the user does:**
Dataset column names, sample values for each column, intended use case

**What they see as output:**
A list of discriminatory proxy features detected, what protected attribute each proxies for, risk level, and suggested transformations

**How Gemini AI is used:**
Analyze the dataset features for proxy discrimination — features that correlate with protected attributes (race, gender, age, etc.) even when those attributes aren't directly present. Flag each with risk level and suggest data transformations.

## UI STYLE REQUIREMENT
FLAT DESIGN UI STYLE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Core concept: Zero depth. No shadows, no gradients, no skeuomorphism. Pure color blocks,
sharp edges, and bold typography. Every element is defined by color contrast alone.

Visual language:
- Bright, saturated flat colors (pick a bold primary + 2-3 complementary colors)
- No box-shadows, no gradients, no blur effects
- Sharp 0px or minimal (4px max) border radius
- Bold, large typography — font weight 700-900 for headers
- Flat icons (use lucide-react, strokeWidth 1.5-2)
- Color blocks define sections — alternating background colors
- Buttons are solid color rectangles with no effects
- Flat illustration-style decorative elements using CSS shapes

Layout rules:
- Clear section-based layout with color-defined zones
- Full-width colored header section
- Content in a clean grid below
- Results displayed as flat colored cards/tags
- Strong color contrast for all text (WCAG AA minimum)

Colors: Choose a bold palette — one dominant color, one action color, neutral base.
Fonts: Choose a bold geometric or humanist sans-serif. Avoid thin weights.
DO NOT: add shadows, add gradients, add blur, use rounded pill shapes.

## GEMINI API INTEGRATION
- Model: `gemini-1.5-flash`
- API Key env var: `process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY` (available server-side only)
- API Endpoint in your route: `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash:generateContent?key=${API_KEY}`
- The API route is at: `/api/generate` (POST)
- Request body your page sends: `{ "prompt": "user input text here" }`
- Response your API route returns: `{ "result": "gemini response text" }`

Gemini prompt to use in your API route (customize for this tool):
"You are a data discrimination detection AI. Analyze these dataset features for proxy discrimination. For each suspicious feature, explain: what protected attribute it likely proxies (e.g., zip code → race, name → gender), the proxy mechanism, risk level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW), and a specific transformation or mitigation to reduce the proxy effect. Be precise with examples."

Append the user's actual input to this system prompt when calling Gemini.

## TECH CONSTRAINTS (STRICT)
- Framework: Next.js 16, App Router (`app/` directory)
- Language: TypeScript (.tsx files)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS + custom CSS variables in globals.css
- Icons: lucide-react only (already installed)
- NO additional npm packages — only: next, react, react-dom, lucide-react, tailwindcss
- Build command: `next build --no-turbo`
- Node engine: 24.x
- The Gemini API call happens in `app/api/generate/route.ts` (server-side only)
- The page uses client-side fetch to call `/api/generate`
- Add `'use client'` directive to `app/page.tsx`

---

## FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
1. User sees a clean, styled input form matching the UI style described above
2. User fills in the required input fields (described in "What the user does" above)
3. User clicks a submit/analyze button
4. A loading state is shown while waiting for Gemini
5. The Gemini response is displayed in a well-styled results section
6. The result should be parsed and displayed with visual hierarchy (not just raw text)
7. Error states are handled gracefully
8. The page is fully responsive (mobile + desktop)

---

## OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY)
Respond with EXACTLY this structure. No text before or after. No markdown code fences
inside the blocks. Use these exact delimiters:

--- FILE: app/page.tsx ---
[complete TypeScript React component code here]
--- FILE: app/api/generate/route.ts ---
[complete Next.js API route code here]
--- FILE: app/globals.css ---
[complete CSS with Tailwind directives and all custom styles here]
--- END ---

---

## QUALITY REQUIREMENTS
- The UI must look PROFESSIONAL and POLISHED — not like a placeholder
- The UI style must be immediately recognizable as Flat Design
- Loading states must be visually clear
- Results must be formatted with visual hierarchy, not raw text dumps
- The tool name "DataMirror" must appear prominently in the UI
- Color palette must reflect: deep purple and clean white — analytical precision meets human ethics
- Choose distinctive, non-generic fonts (use Google Fonts via @import in globals.css)
- The app should feel like a real product someone would use

Generate now. Only output the three file blocks.
