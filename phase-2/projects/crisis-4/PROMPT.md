## YOUR TASK

You are an expert frontend developer and UI designer. Generate a complete,
production-ready Next.js 16 web application as a working MVP.

The website title (shown in browser tab and on page) must be: **CrisisScript**

## PROBLEM CONTEXT

Hospitality venues face unpredictable, high-stakes emergencies that demand instantaneous,
coordinated reactions to protect lives and property. During a crisis, critical information is
often siloed, fracturing communication between distressed guests, on-site staff, and first responders.

Objective: Design a robust solution to instantly detect, report, and synchronize crisis response
efforts across a decentralized hospitality ecosystem. Eliminate fragmented communication by
creating a highly reliable bridge between distressed individuals, active personnel,
and emergency services.

## THIS TOOL

**Tagline:** Generate public announcement scripts for any emergency type instantly
**Domain:** hospitality emergency management, crisis coordination, safety systems

**User inputs:** Emergency type, venue name, current status, audience (guests/staff/media), tone needed
**User sees:** Three announcement scripts: PA system announcement, staff briefing script, and social media statement

## UI STYLE

TERMINAL / HACKER UI STYLE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Core concept: Command-line interface aesthetic. Monospace everything. Green on black.
Feels like you're in a 90s hacker movie but functional and modern.

Visual language:

- Background: pure black (#000000) or very dark green-black (#0a0f0a)
- Primary text: bright green (#00ff41 or #39ff14)
- Secondary text: dim green (#008f11)
- Accent: white or bright cyan for highlights
- Font: monospace ONLY (Courier New, Fira Code, JetBrains Mono)
- Borders: 1px solid green, sometimes dashed
- Buttons look like CLI commands: [> EXECUTE] or [$ SUBMIT]
- Input fields look like terminal prompts: "> \_"
- Fake loading/typing animations using CSS
- Scanline effect optional (CSS repeating-gradient overlay)

Layout: Left-aligned, terminal-window style, fake window chrome optional.
Fonts: ONLY monospace. No exceptions.
DO NOT: use colors other than green/black/white/cyan, use rounded corners, use sans-serif.

## GEMINI API INTEGRATION

- Model: `gemini-2.5-flash`
- API key env var: `process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY` (server-side only)
- Endpoint: `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-flash:generateContent?key=${KEY}`
- Your API route: `app/api/generate/route.ts` (POST)
- Page sends: `{ "prompt": "assembled user input" }`
- Route returns: `{ "result": "gemini response text" }`

Gemini system prompt to use in route.ts:
"You are a crisis communications scriptwriter. For this emergency, write 3 scripts: (1) PA System Announcement (calm, clear, 3 sentences max), (2) Staff Briefing Script (tactical, role-specific, 5 bullet points), (3) Social Media Statement (transparent, reassuring, under 280 chars). Each must be appropriate for its audience."

Append the user's actual input to this prompt when calling Gemini.
