## YOUR TASK

You are an expert frontend developer and UI designer. Generate a complete,
production-ready Next.js 16 web application as a working MVP.

The website title (shown in browser tab and on page) must be: **ShipmentNarrator**

---

## PROBLEM CONTEXT

Modern global supply chains manage millions of concurrent shipments across highly complex
and inherently volatile transportation networks. Critical transit disruptions ranging from sudden
weather events to hidden operational bottlenecks are chronically identified only after delivery
timelines are already compromised.

Objective: Design a scalable system capable of continuously analyzing multifaceted transit data
to preemptively detect and flag potential supply chain disruptions. Formulate dynamic mechanisms
that instantly execute or recommend highly optimized route adjustments before localized
bottlenecks cascade into broader delays.

## THIS TOOL

**Name:** ShipmentNarrator
**Tagline:** Paste raw tracking data — get a plain-language shipment story
**Domain:** logistics, supply chain management, route optimization, disruption detection

**User inputs:** Raw shipment tracking log or status updates (any format)
**User sees:** A plain-language narrative of exactly what happened to the shipment, where delays occurred, why, and what to expect next
**Gemini's role:** Translate raw logistics tracking data into a clear, chronological plain-language narrative. Identify delays, explain causes, and predict next steps.

## UI STYLE

AURORA UI STYLE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Core concept: Dark background with flowing, ethereal gradient overlays inspired by the
northern lights. Deep, immersive, and premium feeling.

Visual language:

- Very dark background (#050810 or #0a0a1a)
- 2-4 large blurred gradient orbs (position: absolute, blur: 100-150px, opacity: 0.4-0.6)
  Colors: teal (#00d4aa), purple (#7c3aed), blue (#2563eb), pink (#db2777)
- Cards: dark semi-transparent (rgba(255,255,255,0.05)) with subtle border
- Text: white primary, light grey secondary
- Accent elements have gradient text or gradient borders
- Animated subtle movement on orbs (CSS keyframe, slow 8-12s)
- Input fields: dark glass style

Layout: Full-width sections, centered content, floating cards over the aurora background.
Fonts: Modern, elegant. Inter, Plus Jakarta Sans, or similar.
DO NOT: use light backgrounds, use flat colors, skip the gradient orbs.

## GEMINI API INTEGRATION

- Model: `gemini-2.5-flash`
- API key env var: `process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY` (server-side only)
- Endpoint: `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-flash:generateContent?key=${KEY}`
- Your API route: `app/api/generate/route.ts` (POST)
- Page sends: `{ "prompt": "assembled user input" }`
- Route returns: `{ "result": "gemini response text" }`

Gemini system prompt to use in route.ts:
"You are a logistics translator AI. Convert this raw tracking data into a plain-language shipment story covering: what happened chronologically, where and why delays occurred, current status explained simply, and what to expect next. Write for a non-technical business owner. Be specific about times and locations."

Append the user's actual input to this prompt when calling Gemini.

## TECH CONSTRAINTS

- Next.js 16, App Router (`app/` directory), TypeScript (.tsx)
- Tailwind CSS + custom CSS variables in globals.css
- Icons: lucide-react only
- NO extra npm packages beyond: next, react, react-dom, lucide-react, tailwindcss
- Build: `next build --no-turbo`
- Node: 24.x
- Add `'use client'` to app/page.tsx
- Gemini call is server-side only in route.ts
- Page fetches `/api/generate` client-side

## FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

1. Page title and prominent heading = **ShipmentNarrator**
2. Tagline shown below title: "Paste raw tracking data — get a plain-language shipment story"
3. Input form matching the UI style — all required fields visible
4. Submit button triggers loading state
5. Gemini response displayed with clear visual hierarchy (not raw text)
6. Parse response into sections where possible
7. Handle errors gracefully with user-friendly message
8. Fully responsive — mobile and desktop
