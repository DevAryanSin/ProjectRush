## YOUR TASK
You are an expert frontend developer and UI designer. Generate a complete,
production-ready Next.js 16 web application as a working MVP.

The website title (shown in browser tab and on page) must be: **StaffPulse**

---

## PROBLEM CONTEXT
Hospitality venues face unpredictable, high-stakes emergencies that demand instantaneous,
coordinated reactions to protect lives and property. During a crisis, critical information is
often siloed, fracturing communication between distressed guests, on-site staff, and first responders.

Objective: Design a robust solution to instantly detect, report, and synchronize crisis response
efforts across a decentralized hospitality ecosystem. Eliminate fragmented communication by
creating a highly reliable bridge between distressed individuals, active personnel,
and emergency services.

## THIS TOOL
**Name:** StaffPulse
**Tagline:** Staff check-in during a crisis — get a live team status synthesis
**Domain:** hospitality emergency management, crisis coordination, safety systems

**User inputs:** Multiple staff status updates in plain text (name, location, status, what they see)
**User sees:** Synthesized team situation map: who is where, what each zone status is, gaps in coverage, and recommended redeployment
**Gemini's role:** Synthesize multiple staff check-in messages into a coherent team situation map. Identify coverage gaps, hot zones, and recommend redeployment priorities.

## UI STYLE
NEOMORPHISM UI STYLE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Core concept: Soft extruded 3D elements that appear pressed from the same material as
the background. Everything is the same color family. Depth through dual shadows only.

Visual language:
- Background: a mid-tone flat color (e.g. #e0e5ec or soft warm grey)
- Elements use TWO shadows: light shadow top-left, dark shadow bottom-right
  e.g. box-shadow: -5px -5px 10px #ffffff, 5px 5px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.15)
- Inset version for pressed/active states:
  box-shadow: inset -3px -3px 7px #ffffff, inset 3px 3px 7px rgba(0,0,0,0.15)
- One accent color (soft blue, green, or purple) for active states only
- Minimal text — clean, medium weight
- Icons are monoline, same color family
- NO harsh borders, NO gradients, NO bright colors

Layout: Centered, spacious, generous padding. Elements float softly.
Fonts: Clean rounded sans-serif (Nunito, Poppins). Medium weights.
DO NOT: use multiple colors, use hard borders, use flat shadows, use dark backgrounds.

## GEMINI API INTEGRATION
- Model: `gemini-1.5-flash`
- API key env var: `process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY` (server-side only)
- Endpoint: `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash:generateContent?key=${KEY}`
- Your API route: `app/api/generate/route.ts` (POST)
- Page sends: `{ "prompt": "assembled user input" }`
- Route returns: `{ "result": "gemini response text" }`

Gemini system prompt to use in route.ts:
"You are a crisis coordination AI. Synthesize these staff check-in updates into: (1) Team Status Map (name, location, status for each), (2) Zone Coverage Assessment (which areas are covered/uncovered), (3) Top 3 Coverage Gaps, (4) Redeployment Recommendations. Be tactical and concise."

Append the user's actual input to this prompt when calling Gemini.

## TECH CONSTRAINTS
- Next.js 16, App Router (`app/` directory), TypeScript (.tsx)
- Tailwind CSS + custom CSS variables in globals.css
- Icons: lucide-react only
- NO extra npm packages beyond: next, react, react-dom, lucide-react, tailwindcss
- Build: `next build --no-turbo`
- Node: 24.x
- Add `'use client'` to app/page.tsx
- Gemini call is server-side only in route.ts
- Page fetches `/api/generate` client-side

2. Tagline shown below title: "Staff check-in during a crisis — get a live team status synthesis"
3. Input form matching the UI style — all required fields visible
4. Submit button triggers loading state
5. Gemini response displayed with clear visual hierarchy (not raw text)
6. Parse response into sections where possible
7. Handle errors gracefully with user-friendly message
8. Fully responsive — mobile and desktop
