## YOUR TASK
You are an expert frontend developer and UI designer. Generate a complete,
production-ready Next.js 16 web application as a working MVP.

The website title (shown in browser tab and on page) must be: **PanicTranslate**

---

## PROBLEM CONTEXT
Hospitality venues face unpredictable, high-stakes emergencies that demand instantaneous,
coordinated reactions to protect lives and property. During a crisis, critical information is
often siloed, fracturing communication between distressed guests, on-site staff, and first responders.

Objective: Design a robust solution to instantly detect, report, and synchronize crisis response
efforts across a decentralized hospitality ecosystem. Eliminate fragmented communication by
creating a highly reliable bridge between distressed individuals, active personnel,
and emergency services.

## THIS TOOL
**Name:** PanicTranslate
**Tagline:** Convert a panicked guest message into a calm structured emergency report
**Domain:** hospitality emergency management, crisis coordination, safety systems

**User inputs:** The raw panicked message or call transcript from a distressed guest
**User sees:** Extracted facts: incident type, location, people affected, severity, immediate needs — plus a calm re-statement for responders
**Gemini's role:** Extract structured emergency facts from chaotic, emotional input. Identify incident type, location, affected parties, severity level, and immediate needs. Restate calmly for responders.

## UI STYLE
BRUTALISM UI STYLE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Core concept: Raw, intentional ugliness that commands attention. Thick borders, offset
box shadows, loud typography, high contrast. Nothing is subtle. Everything is intentional.

Visual language:
- White or pale yellow background
- Thick solid black borders (3-5px) on ALL elements
- Offset box-shadows: 4-8px solid black (e.g. box-shadow: 6px 6px 0 black)
- Bold/black font weight (800-900) for all headings
- Uppercase text for labels and buttons
- Primary accent: one loud color (yellow, red, or lime green)
- Buttons are rectangles with thick border + offset shadow, no border-radius
- Hover: shadow reduces to 2px (feels like pressing)
- Input fields: thick bordered, no rounded corners

Layout: Asymmetric, intentional grid breaks, oversized elements, visible structure.
Fonts: Impact, Space Grotesk, or any extra-bold geometric sans-serif.
DO NOT: use rounded corners, use subtle shadows, use gradients, use thin fonts.

## GEMINI API INTEGRATION
- Model: `gemini-1.5-flash`
- API key env var: `process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY` (server-side only)
- Endpoint: `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash:generateContent?key=${KEY}`
- Your API route: `app/api/generate/route.ts` (POST)
- Page sends: `{ "prompt": "assembled user input" }`
- Route returns: `{ "result": "gemini response text" }`

Gemini system prompt to use in route.ts:
"You are an emergency triage AI. Extract structured facts from this panicked message: (1) Incident Type, (2) Location, (3) Number of People Affected, (4) Severity 1-5, (5) Immediate Needs, (6) Caller Status. Then write a calm 2-sentence responder briefing. Ignore emotional noise, focus only on actionable facts."

Append the user's actual input to this prompt when calling Gemini.
