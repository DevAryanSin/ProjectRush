## YOUR TASK

You are an expert frontend developer and UI designer. Generate a complete,
production-ready Next.js 16 web application as a working MVP.

The website title (shown in browser tab and on page) must be: **HazardMap**

---

## PROBLEM CONTEXT

Hospitality venues face unpredictable, high-stakes emergencies that demand instantaneous,
coordinated reactions to protect lives and property. During a crisis, critical information is
often siloed, fracturing communication between distressed guests, on-site staff, and first responders.

Objective: Design a robust solution to instantly detect, report, and synchronize crisis response
efforts across a decentralized hospitality ecosystem. Eliminate fragmented communication by
creating a highly reliable bridge between distressed individuals, active personnel,
and emergency services.

## THIS TOOL

**Name:** HazardMap
**Tagline:** Describe your venue layout — identify hidden hazard zones automatically
**Domain:** hospitality emergency management, crisis coordination, safety systems

**User inputs:** Venue type, number of floors, key areas (lobby, kitchen, pool, event hall etc), occupancy, any known hazards
**User sees:** A hazard zone analysis: risk-ranked areas, specific hazard types per zone, mitigation recommendations, and emergency access notes
**Gemini's role:** Analyze the venue layout description and identify high-risk hazard zones. Rank zones by risk level, specify hazard types, and recommend targeted mitigations.

## UI STYLE

CLAYMORPHISM UI STYLE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Core concept: Soft, inflated, 3D-looking shapes that appear molded from clay. Pastel
colors, thick shadows, rounded everything. Playful and modern.

Visual language:

- Light pastel background (soft lavender, mint, peach, or sky blue)
- Cards appear inflated: border-radius 20-30px, strong drop shadow
  box-shadow: 0 20px 60px rgba(0,0,0,0.12), 0 8px 25px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)
- Elements have a "puffy" quality — generous padding, large border-radius
- Color palette: soft pastels with one punchy accent
- Inner elements also rounded and colorful
- Buttons are pill-shaped or very rounded rectangles
- Slight gradient on card backgrounds (same hue, slightly lighter top)
- Icons are filled, colorful, rounded style

Layout: Centered, card-based, generous whitespace. Feels like a mobile app.
Fonts: Rounded sans-serif (Nunito, Varela Round, Fredoka One for display).
DO NOT: use sharp corners, use dark backgrounds, use thin elements, use flat shadows.

## GEMINI API INTEGRATION

- Model: `gemini-2.5-flash`
- API key env var: `process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY` (server-side only)
- Endpoint: `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-flash:generateContent?key=${KEY}`
- Your API route: `app/api/generate/route.ts` (POST)
- Page sends: `{ "prompt": "assembled user input" }`
- Route returns: `{ "result": "gemini response text" }`

Gemini system prompt to use in route.ts:
"You are a venue safety AI. Analyze this venue layout and identify hazard zones. For each zone: risk level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW), specific hazard types, why it's risky, and 2 mitigation actions. Then list top 3 emergency access recommendations for first responders. Be spatial and specific."

Append the user's actual input to this prompt when calling Gemini.

---

## TECH CONSTRAINTS

- Next.js 16, App Router (`app/` directory), TypeScript (.tsx)
- Tailwind CSS + custom CSS variables in globals.css
- Icons: lucide-react only
- NO extra npm packages beyond: next, react, react-dom, lucide-react, tailwindcss
- Build: `next build `
- Node: 24.x
- Add `'use client'` to app/page.tsx
- Gemini call is server-side only in route.ts
- Page fetches `/api/generate` client-side

## FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

1. Page title and prominent heading = **HazardMap**
2. Tagline shown below title: "Describe your venue layout — identify hidden hazard zones automatically"
3. Input form matching the UI style — all required fields visible
4. Submit button triggers loading state
5. Gemini response displayed with clear visual hierarchy (not raw text)
6. Parse response into sections where possible
7. Handle errors gracefully with user-friendly message
8. Fully responsive — mobile and desktop
